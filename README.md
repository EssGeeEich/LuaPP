LuaPP - Lua C++ Wrapper

This is the official project page for SGH's LuaPP - Lua C++ Wrapper!

Check [`main.cpp`](https://github.com/EssGeeEich/LuaPP/blob/master/src/main.cpp) to see a wrapping demo.

Please note that LuaPP requires C++17.
It can use the official Lua repository as a submodule, or a globally installed Lua library, depending on the compilation flags.
It has been developed with Lua v5.3 and updated to v5.4.6.
